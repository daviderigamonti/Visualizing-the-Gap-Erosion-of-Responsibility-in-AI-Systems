\section{The Responsibility Gap}\label{sec:responsibilitygap}

% Introduction of the responsibility gap and learning automata description
In his seminal work, Andreas Matthias mentions the presence of a \textit{responsibility gap} \parencite{MATTRG} in the process of ascribing responsibility to agents involved in the activity of creating and interacting with learning automata.
First of all, it's important to understand in which ways autonomous learning systems differ from traditional engineering artifacts; in most cases a learning automaton is able to return outputs following a certain logic that wasn't directly coded by a programmer, but it was ``learned'' by providing examples of expected behavior, this particular approach makes it possible to achieve outstanding feats but at the same time it may raise some concerns on the actual \textit{control} that any agent may have on the system. 

% Comparison with traditional framework and problem of many hands
As we have discussed in the previous section, \textit{knowledge and control} of the agent over the system are fundamental prerequisites for ascribing responsibility (and even more so accountability) in the traditional frameworks; however, when facing a system that has the properties of a \textit{black box} we cannot assume that anybody would be able to know its inner workings, not the creator of the automaton, let alone its potential users.
In addition, even the \textit{causality} conditions may not be satisfied if we consider what is known in the literature as the \textit{problem of many hands} \parencite{POPOM, COEAIR, NISAIA} and consists in the impossibility of generalizing the single agent responsibility to a collective entity, as an unfeasible unfolding of long and convoluted chains of events is needed to fully understand the contribution of each agent.
The problem of many hands is not restricted to the learning automata case, but it is certainly amplified by the fact that AI models are usually composed of many different modules (\textit{problem of many things}~\cite{COEAIR}) which are the product of contributions given by many different people with different skills, ideals and goals.
