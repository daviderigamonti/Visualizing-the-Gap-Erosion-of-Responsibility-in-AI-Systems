\section{Analyzing Responsibility}\label{sec:responsibility}

% Acknowledging responsibility variations
The term \textit{responsibility} is often used as a broad expression to convey the notion of ``someone'' (which can be a person, an institution, a corporation or more generally, an \textit{agent}) having the duty of upholding certain expectations defined by another (or the very same) agent towards a given goal.
It's important to acknowledge the presence of derived terms that represent different ``flavors'' of \textit{responsibility}, in this section we will focus on the specific expressions that are most relevant to this paper, nevertheless, it's important to note that numerous taxonomies can be formulated.

% Main responsibility variations
In the Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI) for self-assessment, \textit{accountability} is defined as a term which refers to the idea that one is responsible for their actions and consequences, therefore they must be able to explain their aims, motivations, and reasons (\cite{ALTAI} as cited in~\cite{NOVAIA}); it is essential to note the presence of an autorithy in charge of supervising the conduct of the agent held accountable and thus, sitting closely to the definition of \textit{answerability} \parencite{NISAIA} in contrast with the notion of \textit{moral responsibility}, which assumes an internal analysis against the very own moral values of the agent of interest.
In addition, it's also possible to identify the \textit{patient of responsibility} figure as someone that is affected by the actions of the agent and is entitled to demand accountability for those actions \parencite{COEAIR}.

% Active / passive responsibility + role responsibility
An important distinction that needs to be made is the difference between \textit{active responsibility} and \textit{passive responsibility} \parencite{ETE}: while the first term is appropriate for addressing the continuous and preemptive effort that one must make to care about a certain goal while it is being attained, the second is applicable in the event that something undesirable has already happened instead and can be subdivided in \textit{accountability}, \textit{blameworthiness} (indirect responsibility) and \textit{liability} (economical/legal responsibility) according to \parencite{ETE}.
Another important aspect of responsibility is its context, as the notion of \textit{role responsibility} suggests, in our daily life we partake in social roles which come with their respective responsibilities that may be conflicting; in particular, \textit{professional responsibility}, is a particular type of role responsibility which concerns the professional life of an agent \parencite{ETE}.

% Feinberg's / Aristotle responsibility interpretation
Feinberg identifies two main causes for an agent to be held morally blameworthy for any given harm: \textit{causality} (the agent's actions contributed in causing the harm) and \textit{faultiness} (the actions were intentionally harmful or a result of negligent behavior) \parencite{FEISC}.
Another viable interpretation is the aristotelian one, which specifies the \textit{control condition} (intent and freedom of action) and the \textit{epistemic condition} (awareness or non-ignorance) \parencite{FISRAC}.
It's easy to see how these frameworks fit quite well with most engineering tasks due to the fundamental instrumentality of the produced artifacts, for example \todo{insert example}.
