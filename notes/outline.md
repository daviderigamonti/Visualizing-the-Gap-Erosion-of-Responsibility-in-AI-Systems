## Brainstorm

- Accountability in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
- Responsibility vs Accountability vs Attributability vs Liability
- Malicious intent, ethics and social goals
- Sentience and effective control over an AI system
- Moral implications of creating a sentient systems will be overlooked
- Indirect responsibility

## Thesis

The **historical** model for determining the **responsibility** of a company/individual that creates an AI system **isn't valid** when looking at **autonomous systems** that tread on the fine line of **sentience**.
A new perspective is needed to effectively discern the full extent of human responsibility when a system is said to be able to "act on its own".
